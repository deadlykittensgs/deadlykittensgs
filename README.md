Hey there! I'm Ryan, also known as @deadlykittensgs on GitHub. I'm deeply passionate about guitar, coding, and all things web development. Currently honing my skills in the latter, I'm eagerly seeking opportunities to collaborate and learn. Fun fact: My IT journey started during a two-month trip to Europe, and I'm definitely planning on revisiting London someday. Let's connect and create something awesome together! 🎸💻✨
